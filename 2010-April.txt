Subject: [spe-users] backwards search
Message-ID: <y2kf1422e941004080545ha979db86hfcbbb12d7491f8ac@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am new user of SPE editor. As I tried around the application
yesterday, I noticed a problem: when I try to find some key words
using the Find/Replace dialog (ctrl + f). I can't search backwards.
The option is there, but it's disabled.  Since I can get any useful
information using Google, perhaps someone here can help me out! I
really appreciate.

thanks

Simon
