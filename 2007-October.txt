Subject: [spe-users] Some requests
Message-ID: <fdr8mo$h02$1@sea.gmane.org>

Some enhancements and feature requests for the current SPE head:
1.When file is reloaded due to modification by another application, it shouldn't be marked as modified.
2.When a file is closed, its contents remain in the text area(though you can't actually do anything 
with them, no save no run) but it's kinda confusing.
3.The "Default" button in the preferences dialog doesn't conform to Windows conventions, Save should 
be the left-most button.
4.Code-completion needs some enhancements, it shouldn't show a list when there's only 1 matching 
variable, it should auto-complete without intervention.

Thanks,
Diaa Sami
