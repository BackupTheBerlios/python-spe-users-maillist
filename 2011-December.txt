Subject: [spe-users] [SPE]How to install SPE for Blender2.6?
Message-ID: <1323075937.317.YahooMailNeo@web15708.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
I'm new to SPE, and thank you for providing such a GREAT debugger for Blender!
I read the spe tutorial for blender(http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.4/Tutorials/Extensions/Python/Editors/SPE),
but the problem is that tutorial is for blender2.4. When I followed the tutorial and install spe for Blender2.6, I found that Blender2.6 use Python3.2, but wxPython doesn't provide the package for python3.2.
So could you give me a guide on how to install spe for Blender2.6? Thank you.

Regards
yaoyansi
