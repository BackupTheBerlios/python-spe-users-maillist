Subject: [spe-users] thanks SPE
Message-ID: <9f7ef8910806200133k436deafcldde951116df422d9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I've known SPE for a while, and always thought it was not only a great ide
but also a great project, for one person to make it such successful.
(Though I don't use SPE too much these days, since it takes too much
cpu in my eee pc)

I got my first credit card today, and proudly used my very first spend
to donate to SPE!
(well, technically it's buying the manual, but I would like to think
different :)

Maybe I can actually contribute to the code someday ;)
Thanks Stani for such a good job, I appreciate it!

(I personally don't have anything to do with Stani. This is NOT an ad
or whatsoever. I just always wanted to try this)

Message-ID: <g42tv1$ejf$1@ger.gmane.org>

The top level "spe" directory is missing a manifest template so the 
generated source distribution is missing a lot of files. It's also 
missing a version number specification so it's named "spe-0.0.0".

The distutils script is missing package and package data items for the 
plugins so they don't get installed.

The attached patch is against r346.

Hi Jason,
Thanks for your will to contribute. ?Are you on Windows? The setup.py
was included for linux installations, which do not install the plugins
from the SPE package so that is why they are not in the manifesto.
(wxglade, kiki, winpdb are installed by their own packages.) To make it
easy for Windows, where there is no packaging system, I decided to
include them inside the SPE source tree.
SPE can be used by just unzipping and running SPE.py. There is no need
for it to be in the site-packages path as it is not a library but an
application. Is there specific reason why you want to install spe with
setup.py? 
Best regards,
Stani

Stani,
   You're more than welcome; SPE is a great product and I'd like to make 
it easier to distribute and install.

   I'm actually not using Windows but rather Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

   There is a specific reason why I want to install SPE with setup.py. 
My employer's custom Python software is (naturally) managed 
independently of the Red Hat packaging system and we have to maintain 
multiple platform-specific installations of Python and third-party 
Python libraries and tools along with it. Our build system relies upon 
the presence of a working setup.py in the archived tarball of every 
third-party library and tool that is integrated into our Python 
installations. Unfortunately, SPE's setup.py can neither produce a 
version-labeled, complete tarball nor a complete installation if its 
plug-ins aren't installed independently. The latter problem is 
especially acute with Kiki and wxGlade because they don't include a 
setup.py in their distributions at all.

   Being that SPE is designed to favor launching the 
independently-installed versions of the plug-ins over its own, SPE's 
redundant plug-in installations aren't an issue for us. It's especially 
nice to have SPE's setup.py install pychecker2 automatically because it 
won't work without it.

   I submitted this patch so that others in our situation would not be 
discouraged from using SPE just because it can't be distributed and 
installed like most other Python tools.

Regards,
Jason
