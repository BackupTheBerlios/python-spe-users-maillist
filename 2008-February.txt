Subject: [spe-users] editor doesn't accept keystrokes ?
Message-ID: <47B6C8B2.3040206@ru.nl>

hello,

I just tried to install SPE (at this moment I'm using PyScripter),
and I've to admit that it looks very good.
Certainly the fact that it's completely written in Python is very 
attractive,
especially because my programs needs the same technics as SPE uses ;-)

Now I noticed that it needs wxPython 2.6,
and I need wxPython 2.8 ;-)
I previous had both wxPython 2.6 and 2.8 installed,
but due to problems I had to remove the 2.6 version.

Now I get the following error when typing in the editor:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File 
"P:\Python\lib\site-packages\spe-0.8.3.a-py2.4.egg\_spe\sm\wxp\stc.py", 
line 208, in OnKeyDown
    key     = event.KeyCode()
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

Is there a simple way to solve this ?
Is it simple to install also wxPython 2.6 (without disturbing 2.8) and 
will that solve the problem ?
Are there any plans to move SPE to wxPython 2.8 ?

thanks,
Stef Mientki
