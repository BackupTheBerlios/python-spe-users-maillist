</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jason,
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your will to contribute. &#65279;Are you on Windows? The setup.py

</I>&gt;<i> application. Is there specific reason why you want to install spe with
</I>&gt;<i> setup.py?

</I>Stani,
   You're more than welcome; SPE is a great product and I'd like to make 
it easier to distribute and install.

   I'm actually not using Windows but rather Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

   There is a specific reason why I want to install SPE with setup.py. 
My employer's custom Python software is (naturally) managed 
independently of the Red Hat packaging system and we have to maintain 
multiple platform-specific installations of Python and third-party 
Python libraries and tools along with it. Our build system relies upon 
the presence of a working setup.py in the archived tarball of every 
third-party library and tool that is integrated into our Python 
installations. Unfortunately, SPE's setup.py can neither produce a 
version-labeled, complete tarball nor a complete installation if its 
plug-ins aren't installed independently. The latter problem is 
especially acute with Kiki and wxGlade because they don't include a 
setup.py in their distributions at all.

   Being that SPE is designed to favor launching the 
independently-installed versions of the plug-ins over its own, SPE's 
redundant plug-in installations aren't an issue for us. It's especially 
nice to have SPE's setup.py install pychecker2 automatically because it 
won't work without it.

   I submitted this patch so that others in our situation would not be 
discouraged from using SPE just because it can't be distributed and 
installed like most other Python tools.

Regards,
Jason
