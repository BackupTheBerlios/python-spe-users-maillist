Subject: [spe-users] Customize Syntax Highlighting Colors
Message-ID: <1262085438.2430.8.camel@MiloToy>

Dear SPE-list, 

sorry if I bring up a frequently asked question (joined the list
yesterday) but as I figured out it is not possible yet to customize the
syntax highlighting colors (?). However, in the "dialogs" folder of the
"_spe" directory (version 0.8.4.i, checked out via svn) there is a
stcStyleEditor.py script basically providing exactly this. Is this going
to be a new feature of the next SPE release or is it possible to
incorporate this dialog into the recent SPE version already?

Thanks a lot!

Matthias
