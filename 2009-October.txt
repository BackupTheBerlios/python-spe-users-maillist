Subject: [spe-users] noob Q: cannot get spe to run scripts in ubuntu 9.04
Message-ID: <4AC60CF1.1080709@gmail.com>

hej spe specialist,

i am very new to python and this list. so i am sorry if i post something 
which has already been covered on this list or elsewhere.

i have installed spe on my computer running ubuntu 9.04... i can lauch 
spe just fine, but when i try to run a script nothing happens....
like described here: 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/jaunty/+source/spe/+bug/377044

i tried to update python to version 2.8 but all i can find in synaptic 
is 3.0

this is to make the following patch:

    The minimal patch is only changing one line:
    sudo gedit /usr/bin/spe

    Change this line:
    MIN_WX_VERSION = '2.5.4.1'

    into:
    MIN_WX_VERSION = '2.8'

    After that you can run your scripts happily again. I'll prepare an
    official patch and attach it to this bug.

i edited the file, but still when starting spe, the version which is 
displayed in the shell is 2.6.2 -- how can i get it to recognize 3.0.1?
or how can i install 2.8 and get it to recognize this?

i really hope you can help me, i am very excited to get up and running 
with python.
thank you very much,
jacob

That is a bug related to pygame. Please ask this on the pygame mailing list.

Subject: [spe-users] SPE and iPython - a solution
Message-ID: <4AE6BFAD.4080707@sil.org>

I've just started to experiment with using iPython 
(http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) and wondered how it could be integrated 
into SPE (http://pythonide.stani.be/). I found a few threads about it, 
but no solutions, so I started digging around in Stani's code and came 
up with the following solution for starters. This doesn't (yet) offer 
any other functionality from SPE, such as importing a script into the 
iPython shell or drag-and-drop of files onto the panel for execution, 
but it should add an extra panel to SPE containing an iPython shell. I'm 
working under Windows Vista with Python 2.6 and wxPython 2.8, using 
ipython-0.10. Hope this might help someone else.

Best regards,
Timothy Grove

#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# IP_Shell.py - version 0.1.0

from IPython.gui.wx.ipython_view import IPShellWidget

class Panel(IPShellWidget):
    """
    A simple class to add an iPython panel to SPE.

    To use:
    1. Create a file with this code, named 'IP_Shell.py', and add it to 
\_spe\tabs\.
    2. Duplicate 'shell.png' in \_spe\skins\default\ and rename it to 
'ip_shell.png' .
    3. Edit 'Parent.py' in \_spe\. Change 'TABS = ['Shell','Locals', 
...]' (line 44 in my editor) to
                                          'TABS = 
['Shell','IP_Shell','Locals', ...]'.
    """

    def __init__(self,panel):
        IPShellWidget.__init__(self, panel)
